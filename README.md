## :scroll: Description
Entry for the Jetpack Compose Dev Challenge.

This is a really simple app that shows a list of Pets and shows Details for each one on click.
The used data is all placeholder data that gets stored in a sqldelight backed database.
All Sample Images are downloaded from [placekitten.com](https://placekitten.com)

Thx to Kathi for the paw print Image Mask!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I haven't done any development for android in a while and felt the need to freshen up on my Android knowledge.
While researching what's current in Android dev i stumbled upon Jetpack compose and got instantly interested.
A replacement for the admittedly often quite cumbersome Android Widgets using a declarative approach felt quite welcome to me.
I was following [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for a bit and really liked what they were doing but didn't really feel like learning Dart for an UI Framework.

## Challenges and Problems
The composables get sometimes overdrawn when scrolling and don't show their content anymore
